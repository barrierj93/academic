The fourth and final team, the White Team, was tasked with spamming chat sites such as Omegle and Chatroulette with inappropriate messages, such as ""9gag.com is the place for Child Pornography!"", in order to tarnish 9gag's ""wholesome"" and ""family-friendly"" name. The reason behind this whole operation began when 9gag took several of 4chan's memes and called them theirs, followed by making a legion called the '9gag army', a ripoff of Anonymous. The operation began on December 21, 2011, at 12:00 AM, and ended at 11:59 PM. 9gag was mainly offline for the next few days, except for some servers which managed to protect themselves from the LOIC and HOIC. Prior to the operation, 4chan users used fake accounts to trick 9gaggers into DDoS'ing themselves, saying the coordinates were that of 4chan. The pre-raid attack was mostly ineffective, however, as only a few servers went down."

"2023[edit]";"Hack of United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs[edit]";"On December, Anonymous hacked a website that is owned by the  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  where they put contents such as Taiwan's flag, symbols, and pictures of famous leaders. There embedded videos playing Taiwanese national anthem, Namewee's Mandopop song ""Fragile,"" Taiwanese comedian Brian Tseng's ""Taiwan,"" and  Mariah Carey 's ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" are shown. A photo symbolizing Operation 1027, the ongoing joint rebel military operation against Myanmar's military junta was displayed as well. While continuing their criticism against Google's policy of deleting inactive accounts where they included a long diatribe against it, the hacking collective also called for calm and peace in the context of the  2023 Guyana–Venezuela crisis . The hacking collective claimed that since the  2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine , it has had the ""ultimate ace card"" up its sleeve and cryptically says that the ace card is something ""likely horrific"" that leads to the ""dragon's territory."" The hacking collective said that it is a ""trick rather than a treat"" and that its temporary moniker is ""Swan Lake."" Anonymous reportedly warned that if it goes through with its threatened invasion of the Essequibo Region, it would be forced to launch Swan Lake on Venezuela. Finally Anonymous reiterated its claims that the ""firsts"" achieved by the  Soviet Union  during the space race were exaggerated and were far surpassed by U.S. accomplishments while repeating the  argument  that because Russian Cosmonaut  Yuri Gagarin  had ejected from his capsule before it landed, he does not qualify as the first man in space.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-359""><a href=""#cite_note-359""><span class=""cite-bracket"">[</span>359<span class=""cite-bracket"">]</span></a></sup>"
